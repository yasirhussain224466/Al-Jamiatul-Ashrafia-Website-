                He had only two or three daughters and no son, After the birth
                of daughters, there was no issue up to eight years. He was
                grieved at heart. One morning, he and his wife Bibi Khadija
                Begum رحمتہ اللہ علیہ were sitting together on Musallah (Carper
                for saying prayer) All of a sudden Hazrat Ibrahim Mazzoob رحمتہ
                اللہ علیہ entered in to the palace. Both were astonished to see
                him. Hazrat Sultan Ibrahim رحمتہ اللہ علیہ stood up and went
                forward to greet him. He made him sit on the throne and both
                husband and wife were standing bending their heads before him.
                Seeing such a noble courtesy meted out to him, he said “Probably
                you are desirous of son”. Hearing it both were extremely glad
                and said, “It will be our good luck if you bestow a son” Ibrahim
                Mazzoob رحمتہ اللہ علیہ again said, “It's price is very much as
                I will give you an extra ordinary thing”. Sultan Ibrahim رحمتہ
                اللہ علیہ readily said, “whatever you order, I am ready to
                fulfill it.” Ibrahim Mazzoob رحمتہ اللہ علیہ said, “I want one
                thousand Dinar.” Sultan Ibrahim رحمتہ اللہ علیہ presented one
                thousand dinars before him. Ibrahim, Mazzoob رحمتہ اللہ علیہ
                stood up happily and said, “O Ibrahim (To Himself) you gave hawk
                (baz) to Sultan Ibrahim and he bought it cheap.” Hazrat Sultan
                Ibrahim رحمتہ اللہ علیہ went forward with him as a respect.
                Turning back, Ibrahim Mazzoob رحمتہ اللہ علیہ saw him and said,
                “What do you want more; you have got your son.” It is also
                narrated that one-night Hazrat Mohammad Mustafa (صلى الله عليه

                Syed Ashraf Jahangir Simnani رحمتہ اللہ علیہ asked her to

                to his younger brother, Sultan Muhammad Aaraf رحمتہ اللہ علیہ.
                He acquainted his mother, Khadija Begum, with the suggestion and
                direction given by Hazrat Khidr, (Alaihissalam) and sought his
                permission to leave Simnan and travel towards his destined goal,
                Pandwa Shareef, in India. The pious mother blessed him and said,
                “ Before your birth Khwaja Almad Yeswi predicted ; “A son will
                be bestowed whose sun of sanctity (Welayat ) will illuminate the
                darkness of the world at large” Narrating this, She happily
                permitted him to make journey towards his fixed goal though it
                was against the nature of a mother to bid his son farewell
                forever; but she knew it beforehand that real destination of
                Hazrat Syed Ashraf Simnani رحمتہ اللہ علیہ was not simnan rather
                it was Pandawa Shareef in India where he would reach to the peak
                of spirituality , he left for his destined goal with twelve
                thousand soldiers. They accompanied him up to three stages; But
                he asked them to return to the country from there he started
                Journey only with a servant to some distance and he was also
                asked to return to simnan after accompanying him for some days.
                From there he marched towards his cherished place leaving behind
                even the animal on which he was riding. It is also a historical
                fact that a renowned Sufi; Hazrat Alauddola Simnani رحمتہ اللہ

                rather continued his journey to arrive at his destined goal as

                        (2) Once a woman, taking his half dead son, came to his
                        Khanqah (an abode for holy man) and entreated with
                        tearful eyes to pray for his life. In the meantime, the
                        boy took his last breath and died before him. She began
                        to weep bitterly and said with folded hands. You are
                        Allah’s friend (Waliullah); Bring my son to life.” He
                        said, “life and death are in the hand of Allah; what a
                        slave (Banda) can do.” Hearing it, the ill-fated woman
                        started weeping with such mournful voice that his heart
                        filled with pity and an astonishing condition prevailed
                        on his face. Solacing the grieved woman, Hazrat Makhdoom
                        Simnani رحمتہ اللہ علیہ said in full eminence (Jalal),
                        "I give ten years from my life and after ten years this
                        boy will die.” He prayed to Allah for his life and
                        ordered the dead boy to stand up in the name of Allah.
                        The dead boy stood up and got life for ten years. Truly
                        he died after ten years.

                        (3) On his return from Pandawa Shareef one morning he
                        was sitting with his disciples after prayer of Ashraque
                        (Prayer after Sunrise) Some jesters came there to
                        ridicule him. They brought an alive man wrapped in
                        coffin in the shape of a dead body and requested him to
                        say funeral prayer. When these jesters pressed him much,
                        he asked one of his disciples to say funeral prayer
                        according to their wishes. The disciple said funeral
                        prayer. They were waiting for his standing up but he was
                        actually dead. This astonishing miracle spread just like
                        wild fire in the town and created uproar. Hazrat Nizam
                        Yamani رحمتہ اللہ علیہ has written a couplet on this
                        incident. <br />

                        Once Hazrat Makhdoom Simnani, رحمتہ اللہ علیہ with his
                        disciples were passing through Banaras. One of the
                        disciples was fascinated to see an idol in the temple
                        and kept on seeing it. The caravan of Makhdoom Simnani
                        رحمتہ اللہ علیہ had marched to some distance; it came to
                        know that a disciple lagged behind and is in the temple.
                        Hazrat Makhdoom Simnani رحمتہ اللہ علیہ asked one of his
                        followers to go and tell the idol to come with him. He
                        went there and told as he was ordered. The idol moved
                        and changed in to a beautiful girl and came before him
                        and embraced Islam. Hazrat Makhdoom Simnani رحمتہ اللہ
                        علیہ got his lover disciple married with the idol.
                        <br />
                        Truly Hazrat Maulana Room has said: <br />

                          Aulia Ra Hast Qudrat Azilah <br />

                        <br />
                        The above stated miracles indicate his mystical and
                        spiritual status and also extraordinary and most
                        valuable services to the cause of Islam. It can be said
                        without fear of contradiction that so long the world
                        exists, the flag of his greatness and supremacy will
                        continue unfurling and candle of spirituality lighted by
                        him will go on showing light to humanity. Every follower
                        of Ashrafiya order should endeavor to follow the
                        doctrines laid down by him so that one may avail the
